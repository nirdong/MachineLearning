the first thing that comes/pops to my mind is














1. Do you like going boating?
For sure I like it. 


For sure I like it. as it is a beautiful and enjoyable way to see some city or area or just enjoy the scenery that passes by.

版本二：Absolutely, I am a big fan of boating which is a great outdoor sport. Being out in the fresh air and sunshine boosts your mood and contributes to youroverall fitness. More importantly, as soon as you step off the dock, you have an unbridled sense of freedom.

2. Have you ever travelled by boat?

Oh, dozen times, I guess. Boating is perfect way for me to unwind and reconnect in the natural environment. So, yeah, I always try to go on a boat trip while traveling near the water.

3. Would you like to have your own boat?

Oh yeah, I would do it with pleasure. I think it is an excellent investment and also a great fun and one of the best way to draw a family together.

版本二：Yes, definitely! I've been longing for a cruise tour for ages since I watched the film Titanic, it looked so cool and luxurious to be on a ship with restaurants, bars and everything on it. Also, you can enjoy the gorgeous sunset on the sea, so I think cruising is the best way to travel as long as the ship doesn't crash with an iceberg like what happened in the film.

版本三：No, not really. I get seasick easily, so staying on a boat for too long is absolutely not a good idea for me. I still remember that I had a 30-minute boat tour when I was travelling on LIJIANG river and kept throwing up for 10 minutes afterwards, it was a nightmare.

4. Is boat trip popular in your country?

No, not really, because China’s railway system is so advanced that most people under most circumstances will chose it over boat travel. but the sightseeing by boat on Changjiang river is a fun journey for many.

5. Do you often travel by boat?

first of all, travel有两种意思，出行和旅游，那么我们都在什么时候会坐船出行呢?试想住在意大利的威尼斯(Venice)或者云南水乡(watery place/region)的同学的日常出行除了坐船可能也并没有其他选择(other choices/alternatives)，船是不可或缺(indispensable)的交通方式。这道题给肯定回答的话同学们要注意，千万不要说完自己的家乡is just like Venice之后就so, you know～～～考官可能会直接给你一个"NO I DON'T"(不要问老师是怎么知道的，都是泪)我们的答题原则是话一定要讲清楚!讲清楚!讲清楚!(重要的话说三遍)后面依然需要解释一个watery place就是一切城市设施(facilities)都建在水上(above water)而不同于普通的城市，并没有所谓的"路"(there are no so-called "roads")，这样才算讲清楚了。

那么相信更多的同学可能都不会把船当成日常出行的主要交通工具(means of transport)吧，所以先要强调出行目的是旅行，可以用到go on a long journey(进行一次长途旅行)或者go on a trip(没有强调长途的旅行)这些表达。而在旅行途中我们需要坐船的场合(occasion)也无非是在游览景区的水域(go sightseeing on a lake/down the streams,)时，其他时候选择搭乘飞机或火车(take a plane/train)会帮我们节省掉很多时间(save somebody a lot of time)。

版本一：Actually I would say yes, taking a boat is like the indispensable transport in my daily life, because I live in a watery place in the south-west of China, which is just like the Venice. We go everywhere by boat since the all the houses and facilities are built above water, there are no so-called "roads". So speaking of travelling to another place, I don't really have any alternative but taking a boat.

版本二：Not really, mostly when I go on long journeys, apparently it saves me more time to travel by plane or train. When I need to go somewhere nearby my location, I prefer to drive there or take a bus. Actually I can't think of any occasion when taking a boat could be a preferable mean of transport, unless you want to go sightseeing around a lake or down the streams etc., which does not happen on most of my trips.

6. Where in your country do people most often use/travel by boats?

比较常规的思路当然是沿海地区(coastal areas)的人们更有机会(have more chances/opportunities)乘船出行，普通市民可以出海游玩(have a boat tour on the sea)，宏观来讲，船只对于城市的作用自然是港口(habour)运输，"通过船来运输"可以直接用动词ship来表达，货物大家都知道是goods，"在港口之间"介词用between/from/to都是可以的。在一些沿海大城市很多人都有自己的游艇(yacht)，而且港口对于进出口(import/export goods)也是至关重要的(important/significant/indispensable)。注意import跟export都是及物动词，后面一定要跟名词，不能什么都不跟。如果不想重复goods的话跟一个things/stuff也是可以的。

Perhaps people who live in coastal cities have more chances to travel by boats. Obviously, it's easier for them to have a boat tour on the sea or ship goods from/to other habours. For instance, in my hometown, a lot of people even have their own yachts. Plus, there are quite a few habours which are significant means of importing and exporting stuff.

There're lots of watery places in the south-west of China, which are just like the Venice. For people there, taking a boat is like the indispensable transport in their daily lives. They go everywhere by boat since the all the houses and facilities are built above water, there are no so-called "roads". So speaking of travelling to another place, they don't really have any alternative but taking a boat.

7. Do many people in your country own their own boat?

题目解析：

买不买自己的船取决于两个方面：需不需要(whether it's necessary)以及买不买得起(whether they can afford it)。很明显在中国大部分人(most people, the majority of people)并不需要，因为大部分人住在内陆(the inner part of the mainland)。即使是对于住在沿海城市(coastal cities)的人来说，出海的频率(frequency)也不会高到需要买一艘自己的船(private boat)。只有壕(well off/fortunate/wealthy/rich people)才买得起(afford)船，而且正常也都是小游艇(yacht)。(家里有游轮(cruise)的请联系我。)

I wouldn't say so. The majority of people in my country live in the inner part of the mainland, so they don't need a boat most of the time. Even for the people who live in coastal places, it's not necessary to own a private boat because they don't need it that often. For my knowledge, only a few well off people can afford their own yachts for entertainment.

版本二：For people in the south of China, many of them own fishing boats ‘cause like I said, they catch fish to make a living.And at some tourist spots near the ocean, local people tend to buy speedboats and they would rent them to tourists, but in my hometown or other cities in the north, people seldom buy boats ‘cause it’s just not necessary.

8. Would you like to buy a boat?

No, I don’t think so, ‘cause first of all, I have no place to put it, besides, like I said, I don’t like to go boating ‘cause it gives me seasickness. So having a boat is just a waste of money for me.

9. If you had your own boat, what would you do with it?

Um… I would probably just rent it to someone else, ‘cause it’s no use to me, and it would take up so much space. If I rent it to others, I could at least make some money from it.

robust physical health and vigo


We all have conversations, but some people enjoy talking more than others: those people are talkative. Actually I just have a good friend named Lenny who likes to talk. He was my classmate in southwestern university of finace and economics, where we got bachelors degree of Statistics. Usually talkative people impressed us with their robust physical health and rigor. Lenny could keep talking about his tough childhood without stopping, even when we were at a long distance run of 6 miles around campus, whereas as I could only be the listener. He did a lot of wide range extra reading and has a tanacius memeory. So he could always strick up intereting conversition easily, and enjoying sharing his idea with students majoyed in economics, fiance, and even physics. Now he is an invest manager for a venture capital firm. Talking takes up almost half of his working time. He talk to many entrepreneus to sift possible good projects. He talk to people from the same industry to get new information. He talk to different potential investors to introduce those projects again and again for whole weeks sometime. Too much repeated commercial talks with clear objective made him feel boring, but when we grab a beer at the bar, he seems has no intention of stopping the talk about his girlfriend and new concept read from the recent book to listen my sotries without my interrupting. However we are still good friend. The way he talked repeatedly inspired me that speak out what you learn is a good way of studying. I guess I should thank him for providing me a lot of useful finacial and business infromation and thank him for his trivial talks that make us laugh.  fa

A person who is talkative likes to talk — she's friendly and ready to gab at all times about just about anything.

We all have conversations, but some people enjoy talking more than others: those people are talkative. They find it easy to strike up a conversation, unlike others who may be shy. Being talkative is associated with being friendly. Talkative people can also be described as chatty, garrulous, loquacious, talky, and likely to talk your ear off. If you don’t feel like chatting, you'd better avoid talkative people. The root word of talkative is the Middle English tale, or "story."

Actually this topic reminds me of a boy named Jason. I knew Jason from an international exchange program in Chicago University last year. It was my first time got to know him but soon we became good friends. He is a charming boy who is also pretty stout. But what makes him a real popular program in our class is his perfect personality, you know, quite outgoing and approachable. Actually, what I can learn from him is his inter-personal communicative skills. Or, in other words, being talkative. That’s our first time to participate in an English program with so many classmates with many countries. For the first week, I felt hard to get along with my teammates, as I was reluctant to speak to others. But it seemed like Jason was having a great time with his teammates. And I notice that, Jason was glad to talk and share his ideas with others, though he was not always fluent. I wouldn’t say he talked too much, I guess he just made good use all possible opportunities to practice and interact with others which was actually beneficial. At the end of that exchange program, I turned to another person and I guess I should be thankful to Jason because he was the person who really inspired me.

There’s talking, there’s talking a lot, there’s talking nonstop, and then, there’s you. Talkative people have it so much worse than regular people because there’s so much to talk about & so less time.

Most people don’t understand how you have the ability to yap from the time you’re awake to the time you fall asleep (and sometimes even in your sleep), but that’s okay. You don’t need people to understand; you just need them to listen.

Here are the signs of a person who just LOVES to talk.

1. You love sharing news with your friends the moment you hear it

2. You can make conversation with almost anyone

Sabji walas, watchmen, and random strangers in the train know your pant size.

6. You are known to be the blabbermouth among your friends/family
11

Blah, blah, blah….blah, blah, blah.

 

7. In school, your teachers were tired of you talking too much in class
6

And your diary was full with “Talking in class” remarks.

 

8. You can easily be ready with at least 5 answers for every question in an interview
10

You truly are your own favourite.

 

9. All things unnecessary is your thing
9

Enough said. Or not.

 

10. Eating takes you longer than others
12

Because you just remembered something you had to say.

 

11. You often end up spoiling TV shows and movies for people because of your talking
13

And you feel really bad about it later.

 

12. But, you are the glue that holds your group together
15

And you make everything more lively by being a part of it.

 

13. You are the reason your friends know everything about your other group of friends
13_1opt

And they get to meet new people in the process.

 

14. There is no silent and dull moment when you are around
14_1opt

Because you can put life into anything by being you.

 

15. And someday, you will be able to put your talent to the best possible use
14

As a storyteller or a  motivational speaker. The world needs more of that.
