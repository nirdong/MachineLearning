A house plan is an abstraction of physical house that allows you to focus on structural elements without being overwhelmed by incidental detials such as the color of the kitchen canbinets-details that are important to the overall look of the completed house, but not to the relationships among the house's main parts.

You can't use these algorithm, and instead you need find others, if they exist, that perform better.

When choosing algorithms, you often have to settle for a space/time trade-off. An algorithm can be designed to gain faster run times at the cost of using extra space(memory) or the other way around. Some users might be willing to pay for more memory to get a faster algorithm, whereas others would rather settle for a slower algorithm that economized on memory.

Unlike aerobics, walking entails no expensive fees for classes or clubs.

The job entails a lot of hard work.

The method, called Complexity Analysis, entails reading the algorithm and using pencil and paper to work out some simple algebra.

The overhead light was covered now with a white globe.

These two types of structures take different approaches to storing and accessing data in the computer's memory.
These approaches in turn lead to different space/time trade-offs in the algorithms that manipulate the collections.

The implication took a while to sink in.
