Although some of what you learn in computer science comes and goes with changes in technology, the basic priciples of orgnizing collection endure.<br>

upside-down pyramid  = inverted pyramid

A house plan is an abstraction of physical house that allows you to focus on structural elements without being overwhelmed by incidental detials such as the color of the kitchen canbinets-details that are important to the overall look of the completed house, but not to the relationships among the house's main parts.

You can't use these algorithm, and instead you need find others, if they exist, that perform better.

When choosing algorithms, you often have to settle for a space/time trade-off. An algorithm can be designed to gain faster run times at the cost of using extra space(memory) or the other way around. Some users might be willing to pay for more memory to get a faster algorithm, whereas others would rather settle for a slower algorithm that economized on memory.

Unlike aerobics, walking entails no expensive fees for classes or clubs.

The job entails a lot of hard work.

The method, called Complexity Analysis, entails reading the algorithm and using pencil and paper to work out some simple algebra.

The overhead light was covered now with a white globe.

These two types of structures take different approaches to storing and accessing data in the computer's memory.
These approaches in turn lead to different space/time trade-offs in the algorithms that manipulate the collections.

The implication took a while to sink in.

Suffice to say, it was more than a couple of years ago!

This description didn't seem to tally with what we saw.

Perfume too seemed to emanate from the glorious hair and white clinging vestments of she herself.

1.
I'm not like that at all. Not in the least. 

我哪里是那种人。绝对不是。

2.
Her sudden appearance did not seem to perturb him in the least. 

她的突然出现似乎一点也没有令他不安。

3.
He didn't seem to mind public opinion in the least. 

他对公众舆论似乎一点都不在乎.
