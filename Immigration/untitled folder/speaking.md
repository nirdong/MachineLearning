We all have conversations, but some people enjoy talking more than others: those people are talkative. Actually I just have a good friend named Lenny who likes to talk. He was my classmate in southwestern university of finace and economics, where we got bachelors degree of Statistics. Usually talkative people impressed us with their robust physical health and rigor. Lenny could keep talking about his tough childhood without stopping, even when we were at a long distance run of 6 miles around campus, whereas as I could only be the listener. He did a lot of wide range extra reading and has a tanacius memeory. So he could always strick up intereting topics easily, and enjoying sharing his idea with students majoyed in economics, fiance, and even physics. Now he is an invest manager for a venture capital firm. Talking takes up almost half of his working time. He talk to many entrepreneus them to sift possible good projects. He talk to people from the same industry to get new information. He talk to different potential investors to introduce those projects again and again for whole weeks sometime. Too much repeated commercial talks with clear objective made him feel boring, but when we grab a beer at the bar, he seems has no intention of stopping the talk about his girlfriend and new concept read from the recent book to listen my sotries without my interrupting. I finnaly realized that he is not tired of talking itself, he is just tired of working topics. He still enjoyes it. 

A person who is talkative likes to talk — she's friendly and ready to gab at all times about just about anything.

We all have conversations, but some people enjoy talking more than others: those people are talkative. They find it easy to strike up a conversation, unlike others who may be shy. Being talkative is associated with being friendly. Talkative people can also be described as chatty, garrulous, loquacious, talky, and likely to talk your ear off. If you don’t feel like chatting, you'd better avoid talkative people. The root word of talkative is the Middle English tale, or "story."

Actually this topic reminds me of a boy named Jason. I knew Jason from an international exchange program in Chicago University last year. It was my first time got to know him but soon we became good friends. He is a charming boy who is also pretty stout. But what makes him a real popular program in our class is his perfect personality, you know, quite outgoing and approachable. Actually, what I can learn from him is his inter-personal communicative skills. Or, in other words, being talkative. That’s our first time to participate in an English program with so many classmates with many countries. For the first week, I felt hard to get along with my teammates, as I was reluctant to speak to others. But it seemed like Jason was having a great time with his teammates. And I notice that, Jason was glad to talk and share his ideas with others, though he was not always fluent. I wouldn’t say he talked too much, I guess he just made good use all possible opportunities to practice and interact with others which was actually beneficial. At the end of that exchange program, I turned to another person and I guess I should be thankful to Jason because he was the person who really inspired me.

There’s talking, there’s talking a lot, there’s talking nonstop, and then, there’s you. Talkative people have it so much worse than regular people because there’s so much to talk about & so less time.

Most people don’t understand how you have the ability to yap from the time you’re awake to the time you fall asleep (and sometimes even in your sleep), but that’s okay. You don’t need people to understand; you just need them to listen.
